<p>Now that you understand a bit about the programs we provide, let’s talk about what you’re looking at in a typical training day. One of the cornerstones to our program is the customization we afford our athletes by providing “mandatory” and “optional” training pieces.For our MFT and Age Group programs, each day you’ll first see anywhere from 3-4 mandatory training pieces, followed by directions as to how many of the following optional pieces you should choose from. When choosing optional work, we’re expecting you to pick the things you least want to do, and therefore probably need to do most. Once again, RELATIVE intensity is your fast track to success. Attempting to perform more work than you’re ready for or able to recover from is a recipe for disaster. We usually recommend athletes begin with the Hatchet volume (3 pieces per day) and gradually introduce more volume as you adapt to it.</p>

<p>Ok, we’re not trying to insult your intelligence, but so many of you have asked for warm ups in the past that we provide one for you. Note that depending on how many training sessions you do or which training pieces you choose to do first, the warm up may or may not apply. Our warm up is a recommendation, but you should know yourself best as to what you need for the upcoming session.</p>
