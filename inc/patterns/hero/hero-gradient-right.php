<p>MisFit Athletics began as five guys from the great city of Portland, Maine. We are undoubtedly a group of misfits that ended up here from very different paths, which is exactly how we were able to come together to create the program, coaching, media, apparel, and camps that you see today. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our programs are built on the fact that there are no gimmicks that will lead you to the promise land. Any happy, healthy, confident, and hard working athlete can use it as a tool for total preparation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our focus on maintaining this level of authenticity and integrity has drawn thousands of people from dozens of countries into our family, and we can now proudly say that our family has done just as much to create this thing as we have.</p>
